# Sensor Data Reading Repository Fixing Assignment

This repository contains a program written in C++ that simulates real-time sensor data generation.
It generates a primary output file along with several necessary intermediate files such as cache and temp logs.

## Assignment-01
The goal of this assignment is to fix the repository by adding missing files and organizing the folder structure correctly.
Essentially, the task is to repair a "broken" repository.

### What the program does
The program utilizes simple file I/O (Input/Output) techniques in C++. It includes:
- A loop for generating sensor data.
- Real-time recording of the code execution.
- Creation of multiple files during execution, specifically:
  - `cache.txt`
  - `sensor_data.txt`
  - `run.log`
  - `temp.tmp`

#### Output
When the code is executed, it creates a folder containing `sensor_data.txt`.
This is the valid output of the program and contains the generated sensor readings.
